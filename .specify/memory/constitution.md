# React ViewModel Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Hook-First Architecture
Every feature MUST be implemented as a reusable React hook. Hooks MUST be self-contained, independently testable, and documented with clear TypeScript interfaces. Each hook MUST have a single responsibility and expose a clean, predictable API. No organizational-only hooks are permitted - every hook must solve a real user problem.

### II. TypeScript-First Development
All code MUST be written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled. Hook interfaces MUST be explicitly defined with comprehensive type definitions. Generic types MUST be used where appropriate to maximize reusability. No `any` types are permitted without explicit justification and documentation.

### III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory for all hook development: Tests MUST be written first, user-approved, and failing before implementation begins. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced. Every hook MUST have comprehensive unit tests covering all use cases, edge cases, and error conditions.

### IV. Performance Optimization
Hooks MUST be optimized for performance from the start. Memoization MUST be used appropriately to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Custom hooks MUST implement proper dependency arrays and cleanup functions. Performance benchmarks MUST be established and maintained for all hooks.

### V. Developer Experience Excellence
Hooks MUST provide excellent developer experience with clear error messages, helpful TypeScript intellisense, and comprehensive documentation. API design MUST follow React conventions and be intuitive for developers. Examples and usage patterns MUST be provided for every hook.

### VI. Backward Compatibility & Versioning
Breaking changes MUST follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Deprecated APIs MUST be marked with clear migration paths and sunset timelines. New versions MUST maintain backward compatibility unless a MAJOR version bump is justified and documented.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- ESLint and Prettier MUST be configured with React-specific rules
- All code MUST pass linting checks before commit
- Code coverage MUST maintain minimum 90% threshold
- All public APIs MUST be documented with JSDoc comments

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests MUST cover all hook logic and edge cases
- Integration tests MUST verify hook behavior in real React components
- Visual regression tests MUST be implemented for hooks with UI dependencies
- Performance tests MUST validate hook efficiency under load

### Documentation Standards
- README MUST include installation, basic usage, and API reference
- Each hook MUST have dedicated documentation with examples
- TypeScript interfaces MUST be self-documenting with clear comments
- Migration guides MUST be provided for breaking changes

## Quality Assurance

### Pre-Release Checklist
- All tests MUST pass (unit, integration, performance)
- TypeScript compilation MUST succeed with no errors
- Bundle size MUST be within acceptable limits
- Documentation MUST be complete and accurate
- Examples MUST be tested and working

### Release Process
- Automated testing MUST run on all supported Node.js versions
- Bundle analysis MUST be performed to detect size regressions
- Performance benchmarks MUST be validated
- Release notes MUST be generated with all changes documented

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and MUST be followed by all contributors. Amendments require:
1. Documentation of the proposed change with rationale
2. Impact analysis on existing codebase and users
3. Approval from project maintainers
4. Migration plan for any breaking changes
5. Update to this constitution with version bump

All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity beyond these guidelines MUST be justified with clear documentation of why simpler approaches are insufficient.
